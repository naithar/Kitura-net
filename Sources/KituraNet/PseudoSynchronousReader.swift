/// The PseudoSynchronousReader class provides an "adapter" between the asynchronous
/// arival of data on the socket and the synchronous read APIs in the upper API layers.
/// Reads from this "adapter", read all available data in it's internal buffer.
///
/// To do this, this class maintains an internal data buffer, a lock, and a semaphore.
///
/// As both the addDataToRead and the read functions modify the internal data buffer (either
/// adding data to it or emptying it out), they both grab the bufferLock before modifying
/// the buffer. An optimization is performed in the addDataToRead, in that if the buffer is
/// empty the lock isn't acquired.
///
/// When the data buffer is empty the read function uses the readingSemaphore to wait, if
/// needed, for data to be added to the buffer.
///
/// **Note:** The Grand Central Dispatch DispatchSemaphore class can act as a classic
/// semaphore and as a lock.
